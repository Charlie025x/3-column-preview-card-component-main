## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project I used flexbox(because I used CSS Grid for the last one) and I got a little better understanding which display style to choose depending on what I'm attempting to acomplish.  CSS Grid is more for creating a grid style layout(where cells can be combined to form areas), and flexbox elements flows in one main direction (can be changed through 'flex-direction: row/width') and will adapt to your viewport. Currently the best way I can explain CSS Grid VS Flexbox in my own words.

### Continued development

Having better understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox, aside from practicing the styling, I will now try to better my judgement on decideing between the two display modes. and identify when to combine them. Plus I will train my eye to reconize when a puplic website is utlizing these tools;

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Tutorial - Flexbox containers](https://youtu.be/hwbqquXww-U) - Nice flexbox tutorial that got me started(I saw the first 2 videos of the 3 video series). Did a great job of explaining how flexbox runs in a selected main axis and how alignment gets customized through its 2 axises.
